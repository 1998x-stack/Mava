# Multi-Agent Distributed Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MAD4PG)

<<<<<<< HEAD
This system is an extension of the Distributed Distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (D4PG) algorithm ([Barth-Maron et al., 2018]) to the multi-agent setting. D4PG leverages both innovations in distributional RL as well as distributed RL to enhance a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) agent. This multi-agent version can be trained in both a decentralised or centralised manner, using a shared critic network between agents.
